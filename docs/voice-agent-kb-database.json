      "answer": "Being specific helps! More specific requests like 'Python for Web Development' or 'Beginner Python for Data Analysis' typically produce more focused, relevant content than just 'Python'. You can also add context like 'for beginners' or 'practical applications' to guide the content generation.",

      "question": "How long does each step take?",
      "answer": "Each step typically takes about 10-15 minutes to complete, depending on the complexity of the topic and how deeply you want to explore it. However, since learning is self-paced, you can spend as long or as little time on each step as you want.",
