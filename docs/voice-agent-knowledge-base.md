## Getting Started & Account Questions

### Q: What is LearnFlow?
**A:** LearnFlow is an AI-powered learning platform that creates personalized learning journeys on any topic you choose. Unlike traditional courses, we generate custom, structured lessons instantly tailored to exactly what you want to learn. You can learn in multiple formats—text, audio, slides, interactive chat with a tutor, or visual diagrams. It's completely self-paced with no deadlines.

### Q: Do I need to create an account to use LearnFlow?
**A:** You can browse and view public learning paths created by our community without an account. However, to create your own personalized learning journey, you'll need to create a free account. You can sign up with your email or use single sign-on if you have an EDNA membership.

### Q: Is LearnFlow free?
**A:** Yes! LearnFlow is completely free. You can create unlimited learning paths, use all learning formats (text, audio, slides, chat tutoring, and visual diagrams), and explore the entire community section at no cost.

### Q: How do I sign up?
**A:** Visit the homepage and click "Start Your Journey" or "Sign Up". You can either create an account with your email address and a password, or if you're an EDNA member, use our single sign-on feature. It takes just a minute.

### Q: Can I use LearnFlow on my phone?
**A:** Absolutely! LearnFlow is fully mobile-responsive, so you can access it on your smartphone, tablet, or desktop. You can learn anywhere, anytime.

### Q: Is my learning data private?
**A:** Yes. Your learning projects and progress are private to your account by default. You can choose to publish learning paths publicly to share with the community, but your private projects remain just for you.

## Feature Explanations

### Q: What can LearnFlow teach me?
**A:** LearnFlow can create learning paths on virtually any topic. Whether you want to learn Python programming, understand the history of jazz, master public speaking, explore machine learning, learn gardening, or understand quantum physics—just type it in and we'll create a structured learning path for you.

### Q: How many steps are in a learning path?
**A:** Every learning path has 10 steps, each building progressively on the last. This gives you a complete journey from foundational concepts to more advanced understanding. Each step takes about 10-15 minutes to complete, though you can go at your own pace.

### Q: What formats can I learn in?
**A:** You have five learning formats to choose from:

1. **Text** - Read lesson content with formatting, code blocks, and markdown
2. **Audio** - Listen to an AI-narrated version of the content (multiple voice options available)
3. **Slides** - View content as visual presentations with key points highlighted
4. **Chat Tutor** - Have an interactive conversation with an AI tutor who answers questions about the material
5. **Visual Diagrams** - See generated mental model images that explain key concepts visually

You can switch between formats anytime or use different formats for different steps.

### Q: Do all learning formats show the same content?
**A:** The core content is the same across text, audio, and slides—just presented differently. The Chat Tutor feature provides interactive Q&A based on the material, and Visual Diagrams provide visual explanations of key concepts. All formats are built from the same AI-generated lesson plan.

### Q: What are Deep Dive topics?
**A:** As you're learning, you might encounter concepts that you want to understand more deeply. Deep Dive topics let you explore related concepts in more detail while staying in context. For example, if you're learning about Python and encounter decorators, you can deep dive into that specific topic for a more thorough explanation.

### Q: What are Related Topics?
**A:** After completing a learning path, the Related Topics section suggests other connected topics you might want to explore next. For instance, after learning Python basics, you might see suggestions for "Object-Oriented Programming in Python" or "Web Development with Python."

### Q: What are Practice Questions?
**A:** AI generates comprehension questions based on the actual content you've learned in each step. These help you test your understanding and reinforce key concepts. You can use them as a quick self-check or study tool.

## Learning Path Creation

### Q: How do I create a new learning path?
**A:** Once you're logged in, click the "Start Your Journey" button (usually on the homepage or projects page) or click the floating "+" button. A dialog will open asking you to enter the topic you want to learn. Type your topic (for example: "Python basics for beginners" or "How to start a vegetable garden"), and our AI will generate a structured 10-step learning plan within 10-30 seconds. You'll review the plan and approve it, then the lesson content starts generating automatically.

### Q: How long does it take to generate a learning path?
**A:** The learning plan itself (the 10 step titles and outlines) generates in about 10-30 seconds. Then the detailed content for each step generates in the background—usually completed within a few minutes. You can start learning immediately while content is still generating in the background.

### Q: Can I customize the learning path after it's created?
**A:** The AI generates the path structure for you. While you can't directly edit the generated content, you can use Deep Dives to explore concepts more deeply, ask the Chat Tutor questions to clarify content, and save Margin Notes on important concepts.

### Q: Can I create a learning path on any topic?
**A:** Yes! We support nearly any topic—technical subjects, creative skills, academic topics, hobbies, languages, business skills, fitness, cooking, and much more. If you can describe it, LearnFlow can create a learning path for it.

### Q: What makes each learning path unique?
**A:** Every time you create a path—even on the same topic—the AI generates completely fresh content based on exactly how you phrase your topic request. So "Python for beginners" will generate different content than "Learning Python from scratch." This personalization ensures each path matches your specific interest.

## Learning & Content Questions

### Q: How long does it take to complete a learning path?
**A:** Most learning paths take 2-4 hours to complete if you go straight through. However, since LearnFlow is completely self-paced, you can take as long as you want. Many users spread learning across multiple days or weeks, returning whenever they have time.

### Q: Can I save my progress and come back later?
**A:** Absolutely! Your progress is automatically saved. You can see all your active learning projects on your Projects page with completion percentages shown. Click "Continue Learning" to pick up right where you left off.

### Q: Can I skip steps or learn out of order?
**A:** While steps are designed to build progressively, you can navigate between steps. However, we recommend going through them in order since each step builds on concepts from previous ones.

### Q: Can I take notes while learning?
**A:** Yes! You can save Margin Notes on specific passages or concepts while reading. These notes are saved to your account and help you remember key insights and important points.

### Q: Can I download or export what I've learned?
**A:** Currently, your learning is stored in your account for reference. You can take screenshots, use your browser's print function, or copy text. We're exploring export options for future updates.

### Q: What happens if I don't understand something?
**A:** You have several options:
1. Use the Chat Tutor feature to ask questions about the material
2. Create a Deep Dive on the concept for a more detailed explanation
3. Look at the Visual Diagrams to see the concept explained visually
4. Re-read the material in a different format (try audio if you read text, or slides if you tried audio)
5. Save a Margin Note with your question and revisit later

## Audio & Voice Features

### Q: Can I listen to the content?
**A:** Yes! Switch to Audio mode and listen to an AI-narrated version of the lesson. The narrator reads through the entire lesson, and you can follow along at your own pace.

### Q: Can I change the voice?
**A:** We offer multiple voice options including Nova, Alloy, Echo, Fable, Onyx, and Shimmer. You can select your preferred voice in the Audio player settings. Different voices have different tones and accents.

### Q: Can I adjust the speed of the audio?
**A:** Yes, you can adjust playback speed in the audio player. Common speeds are 1x (normal), 1.25x, 1.5x, and 2x speed for faster learning.

### Q: What if the audio quality is poor?
**A:** If you experience audio issues:
1. Try refreshing the page
2. Try a different voice option
3. Check your internet connection
4. Try a different browser

## Community & Social Features

### Q: What is the Community section?
**A:** The Community section shows public learning paths created by LearnFlow users. You can browse, search, like, and fork (copy as your own) learning paths created by others. It's a way to discover what topics other learners are interested in and benefit from their learning journeys.

### Q: Can I publish my learning path publicly?
**A:** Yes! Once you've created and approved your learning path, you can choose to make it public. Other users will then be able to find it, view it, like it, and fork it to their own accounts.

### Q: What does "liking" a path do?
**A:** Liking a path indicates you found it useful or interesting. It helps the path gain visibility in the Community section and encourages the creator.

### Q: What does "forking" a path do?
**A:** Forking creates your own personal copy of someone else's learning path. This is useful if you want to use their topic structure but customize it for your own learning. The original creator is credited.

### Q: How are community paths ranked/sorted?
**A:** Community paths can be sorted by:
- **Recent** - Newest paths first
- **Popular** - Most liked paths
- **Views** - Most viewed paths
- **Featured** - Staff-curated selections
- **Trending** - Paths gaining attention recently

### Q: Can I see who created a learning path?
**A:** Yes, each public path shows the creator's profile. You can click to view their profile and see other paths they've created.
