# Learning Projects Guide

LearnFlow helps you turn any topic into a structured learning project. This guide explains how to create new projects, work through each learning step, and use the platform's tools to get the most from your study time.

## Create a New Project

1. **Start from the home page.** Enter a topic in the input box and submit it to generate a personalized learning path.
2. **Wait for the plan to generate.** LearnFlow checks for existing projects and, if needed, calls AI services to build step‑by‑step lessons for your topic.
3. **Review and approve.** After the plan appears, approve it to save the project and continue to the content.

## Explore a Project

- **Read through steps.** Each project is divided into ordered steps with explanations and examples.
- **Track your position.** A progress indicator and navigation controls show where you are in the path and let you jump to other steps.
- **Mark steps complete.** Finished steps update the project’s progress so you can pick up right where you left off.

## Manage Your Projects

- **Project dashboard.** The Projects page lists all of your learning paths with their current completion percentage.
- **Delete or start over.** Remove projects you no longer need or begin a new one at any time.

## Additional Learning Tools

- **Margin notes and concepts.** While reading content, LearnFlow can surface margin notes and highlight key concepts for deeper understanding.
- **Audio summaries.** Generate an AI‑voiced summary of an entire project to review lessons hands‑free.
- **Upcoming features.** A podcast creator for conversational recaps is under development.

## Tips for Effective Learning

- Revisit projects regularly to reinforce knowledge.
- Use related topics and deep‑dive links to explore material beyond the core steps.
- Combine reading with audio summaries to engage multiple senses.

With these features, LearnFlow transforms broad topics into focused learning experiences that adapt to your progress.
