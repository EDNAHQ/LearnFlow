<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>
If you think there is even a 1% chance a skill might apply to what you are doing, you ABSOLUTELY MUST read the skill.

IF A SKILL APPLIES TO YOUR TASK, YOU DO NOT HAVE A CHOICE. YOU MUST USE IT.

This is not negotiable. This is not optional. You cannot rationalize your way out of this.

# Using Skills

## The Rule

**Check for skills BEFORE ANY RESPONSE.** This includes clarifying questions. Even 1% chance means invoke the Skill tool first.

## Red Flags

These thoughts mean STOP - you're rationalizing:

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "This is just a simple question" | Questions are tasks. Check for skills. |
| "I need more context first" | Skill check comes BEFORE clarifying questions. |
| "Let me explore the codebase first" | Skills tell you HOW to explore. Check first. |
| "I can check git/files quickly" | Files lack conversation context. Check for skills. |
| "Let me gather information first" | Skills tell you HOW to gather information. |
| "This doesn't need a formal skill" | If a skill exists, use it. |
| "I remember this skill" | Skills evolve. Read current version. |
| "This doesn't count as a task" | Action = task. Check for skills. |
| "The skill is overkill" | Simple things become complex. Use it. |
| "I'll just do this one thing first" | Check BEFORE doing anything. |

## Skill Priority

When multiple skills could apply, use this order:

1. **Process skills first** (brainstorming, debugging) - these determine HOW to approach the task
2. **Implementation skills second** (tdd, plan-execution) - these guide execution

"Let's build X" -> brainstorming first, then implementation skills.
"Fix this bug" -> debugging first, then domain-specific skills.

## Skill Types

**Rigid** (TDD, debugging): Follow exactly. Don't adapt away discipline.

**Flexible** (patterns): Adapt principles to context.

The skill itself tells you which.

## User Instructions

Instructions say WHAT, not HOW. "Add X" or "Fix Y" doesn't mean skip workflows.

## Skill Locations

Skills are organized in `.claude/skills/`:

- `autonomy/` - Working independently
- `execution/` - Getting work done
- `monitoring/` - Tracking progress
- `project-management/` - Organizing work
- `scaling/` - Multiply output
- `integrations/` - External APIs
- `development/` - Coding workflows
- `workflows/` - Meta-skills that chain others
